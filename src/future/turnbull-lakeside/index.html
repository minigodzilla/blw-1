Proposals are in place which will see approximately 42% of the land developed, leaving the majority of it untouched and preserved as parkland with walking trails.</p>
						<p class="bs-copy bs-animated-item bs-animate-order-3">Based on the approved draft plan, Turnbull Lakeside will feature 188 freehold residences plus a management and security unit. Currently, the west and east sides of the site are already developed residential areas.</p>

						<p class="bs-copy bs-animated-item bs-animate-order-2">Turnbull Lakeside’s management security team will ensure the community maintains its residential value and high standard of living. Services will range from full-time security patrols and managing public spaces, to the maintenance of outdoor spaces and the inspection and repair of common areas. For an added cost, management can even offer personal services such as sending technicians to fix appliances, cleaning teams to maintain residences, providing gardening services and plowing driveways.</p>
