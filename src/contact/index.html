						<h2 class="bs-subheading">Can I arrange to attend and view any one of your ongoing projects?</h2>
						<p class="bs-copy">Yes. Please scroll down and fill out the provided registration form. One of our associates will reply to you as soon as possible.</p>
						<h2 class="bs-subheading">What type of interior finishes do you use?</h2>
						<p class="bs-copy">We offer a variety of different finishes in order to give each home a unique, personalized look. Customers will have an appointment with one of our interior designers prior to construction to help them pick the finishes they would like. Our customers will also have the option to choose upgrades at additional prices.</p>
						<h2 class="bs-subheading">Do you have customer service?</h2>
						<p class="bs-copy">We do. Our friendly, knowledgeable customer services representatives are available to answer your questions.</p>
						<h2 class="bs-subheading">What is the payment schedule in terms of what percentage I need to pay up front and throughout the construction cycle until the move-in date?</h2>
						<p class="bs-copy">As is standard practice in the industry, we require 5% of the cost of our home to be paid up front once you have signed the purchase agreement. Another 5% will be due 6 months later. An additional 5% will be due 1.5 years after your initial payment. Finally, the last 5% will be paid on the closing date. In total 20% of the cost of the home will be due by the closing date.</p>
						<h2 class="bs-subheading">Do your homes come with a warranty? </h2>
						<p class="bs-copy">Yes, we stand behind our developments and stress accountability as one of our key values. All our homes are warranted. You can findÂ coverage details on our <a href="/about-us">About Us</a> page.</p>
